# Telespace ðŸš€


Telespace is a project I've been developing mainly as a uni project, altrought it quickly evolved in something more.
What Telespace gives you, in a nutshell, is the ability to store virtually infinite data, by leveraging Telegram as ultimate storage for your file.

This repo contains the backend, written in Rust btw.
I've been experimenting with Rocket, SeaOrm and Rust in general.



### Run the project:
``` cargo run . ```
It will run in debug mode.

### Compile it:
If you'd like to compile it, just run


``` cargo build --release ```

in your terminal.
After that, move the bin from the target directory back to the root directory of the project and run it.
